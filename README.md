# Random-Password-Generator
This Random Password Generator is a Python-based tool designed to create strong and secure passwords by following best security practices. It ensures that each generated password contains at least one uppercase letter, multiple lowercase letters, 1-3 numbers, and special characters. Users can customize the number of special characters, digits, and total length while maintaining security guidelines.

🔹 Features:
✅ Mandatory uppercase letter: Ensures every password has at least one uppercase letter for added strength.
✅ Customizable length: Users can specify password length (minimum 10 characters recommended for security).
✅ Special character selection: Allows users to include a preferred number of special characters.
✅ Number constraints: Only 1 to 3 digits are allowed to ensure password complexity without predictability.
✅ Secure structure: Every password starts with a letter and ends with a letter or number, improving readability and usability.
✅ Multiple password options: Users can generate multiple passwords at once and select their preferred one.
✅ Error handling and validation: Ensures users input valid values for numbers, special characters, and overall password length.

🔹 How It Works:
1️⃣ The program asks for the desired password length (minimum 10).
2️⃣ Users specify how many special characters and numbers they want.
3️⃣ The remaining characters are filled with lowercase letters and one uppercase letter.
4️⃣ The program generates multiple random passwords for selection.
5️⃣ Users choose one from the generated passwords, ensuring both security and personalization.

This tool is perfect for enhancing security by preventing weak password creation and encouraging strong, unpredictable combinations. Your security is our top priority! 🔒🚀
